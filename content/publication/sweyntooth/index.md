abstract: "We have developed a systematic and comprehensive testing framework, which, as an automated and general-purpose approach, can effectively fuzz any BLE protocol implementation. Our framework runs in a central device and tests a BLE device when the latter gets connected to the central as a peripheral. Our framework incorporates a state machine model of the suite of BLE protocols and monitors the peripheralâ€™s state through its responses. As of the date of publication, we have tested 12 devices from eight vendors and four IoT products, with a total of 11 new vulnerabilities discovered and 13 new Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE) IDs assigned. We call such a bunch of vulnerabilities as SWEYNTOOTH, which highlights the efficacy of our framework."
